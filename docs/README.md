# Docs

The documentation is autogenerated using pdoc.

`docs/` also includes detailed examples generated
with:

`jupyter nbconvert --to html --output-dir docs/epimap/examples examples/*.ipynb --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags=hidden`

`pdoc -d google -o docs/ epimap`

The readme is included in the pdoc doc for `epimap/__init__.py`.
In fact it is included twice so that docs can be generated by calling
the pdoc command directly or by nox.
